```
Table: Products

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
 

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |

### 2. Problem Name: [Find Customer Referee](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-customer-referee/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

### Problem Link: [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-customer-referee/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

```
Table: Customer

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |

+-------------+---------+
In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
 

Find the names of the customer that are either:

referred by any customer with id != 2.
not referred by any customer.

Example 1:

Input: 
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |

+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |

### Problem Link: [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-employee-id-with-the-unique-identifier/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

```
Table: Employees

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the name of an employee in a company.
 

Table: EmployeeUNI

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| unique_id     | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(id, unique_id) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id and the corresponding unique id of an employee in the company.
 

Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show null.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
EmployeeUNI table:
+----+-----------+
| id | unique_id |
+----+-----------+
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |
+----+-----------+
Output: 
+-----------+----------+
| unique_id | name     |
+-----------+----------+
| null      | Alice    |
| null      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |
+-----------+----------+
Explanation: 
Alice and Bob do not have a unique ID, We will show null instead.
The unique ID of Meir is 2.
The unique ID of Winston is 3.
The unique ID of Jonathan is 1.

```

### Solution

```sql
select 
emu.unique_id, 
em.name
from Employees as em
left join EmployeeUNI as emu on em.id = emu.id
```

### 2. Problem Name: [Product Sales Analysis I](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-sales-analysis-i/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

### Problem Link: [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-sales-analysis-i/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

```
Table: Sales

+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| year        | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
| price       | int   |
+-------------+-------+
(sale_id, year) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
product_id is a foreign key (reference column) to Product table.
Each row of this table shows a sale on the product product_id in a certain year.
Note that the price is per unit.
 

Table: Product

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the product name of each product.
 

Write a solution to report the product_name, year, and price for each sale_id in the Sales table.

Return the resulting table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Sales table:
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+ 
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2       | 100        | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7       | 200        | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
Product table:
+------------+--------------+
| product_id | product_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 100        | Nokia        |
| 200        | Apple        |
| 300        | Samsung      |
+------------+--------------+
Output: 
+--------------+-------+-------+
| product_name | year  | price |
+--------------+-------+-------+
| Nokia        | 2008  | 5000  |
| Nokia        | 2009  | 5000  |
| Apple        | 2011  | 9000  |
+--------------+-------+-------+
Explanation: 
From sale_id = 1, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2008.
From sale_id = 2, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2009.
From sale_id = 7, we can conclude that Apple was sold for 9000 in the year 2011.

```

### Solution

```sql
select product_name, year, price from Sales as s inner join Product as p on (p.product_id = s.product_id)
```
