### Problem Link: [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

```
Table: Products

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
 

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

from products
where low_fats = 'Y'
and recyclable = 'Y'
```

### Problem Link: [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-customer-referee/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50)

```
Table: Customer

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |

In SQL, id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the id of a customer, their name, and the id of the customer who referred them.
 

Find the names of the customer that are either:

referred by any customer with id != 2.
not referred by any customer.
Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
